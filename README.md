# Music-recommendation-system

## Project Overview

This project, developed as a graduation project, focuses on building a music recommendation system using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The system is designed to classify a large database of music records, consisting of millions of entries, based on their features.

### Key Components
1. K-Means Clustering Algorithm: Utilized the K-Means clustering algorithm to group similar music records together based on their features. This clustering process forms the backbone of the recommendation system.
2. Data Analysis and Preprocessing: Implemented various data analysis techniques to gain insights into the music dataset. Data cleaning and preprocessing methods were applied to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the clustering algorithm.
3. Website Design: Designed and developed a user-friendly website interface to present the recommendations generated by the algorithm. The website showcases the ten most relevant songs based on the accuracy of the clustering.

## Project Workflow

  1. Data Collection: Gathered a large dataset of music records containing millions of entries.
  
  2. Data Analysis: Analyzed the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
  
  3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Applied data cleaning techniques and preprocessing methods to prepare the data for clustering.
  
  4. Clustering Algorithm Implementation: Implemented the K-Means clustering algorithm to classify the music records into distinct clusters.
  
  5. Website Development: Designed and developed a website interface to display the recommended songs to users (streamlit).
  
  

## Future Enhancements

  1. Incorporate additional machine learning algorithms for more accurate recommendations.
  
  2. Improve the website interface and user experience.
  
  3. Scale the system to handle even larger music datasets efficiently.
